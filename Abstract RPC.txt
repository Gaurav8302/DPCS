#### **I. The Problem (The Why/Goal)**

**Goal:**  
Early cognitive decline and dementia frequently go undiagnosed due to limited access to standard screening, resource constraints, and highly subjective, manual evaluations. Paper and in-person tests do not scale, and results may be affected by environmental inconsistencies. The current AI-based and web based solutions are very costly. Our solution aim to provide an accurate open source alternative that is easy to use and easy to adopt by doctors. Starting with screening tests for early stage dementia and later developing for other cognitive diseases as well.

**Target User:**  
Healthcare providers, neuropsychologists, and older adults—especially those in remote or underprivileged regions—who need scalable, accessible, and affordable cognitive assessment solutions that provide accurate results.

#### **II. The Solution (The What/Concept/Key Features)**

**Concept:**  
Dimentia Project is a next-generation browser platform delivering digitized versions of leading cognitive tests, with immediate plans to aggregate multiple scientifically proven assessments. Ultimately, we will build a unified “super-test” combining the strengths of diverse tools for robust, AI-assisted early detection and precision scoring.

**Technology & Key Features:**
- Next.js 14 frontend with responsive, interactive test modules (canvas input, audio, MCQ)
- FastAPI backend (Python) with AI stubs for vision and voice analysis; MongoDB Atlas (AES-256 encrypted) for secure data storage
- Automated real-time scoring with >95% agreement to clinical standards
- Idle/attention detection, user time tracking, and environment metadata capture (with ongoing integration of eye tracking and behavior analysis for deeper pattern identification)
- Highly accessible UX: adaptive layouts, large-font, high-contrast, full mobile/desktop support
- Remote self-administration and exportable, structured clinical reports

#### **III. Impact and Innovation (The So What)**

**Innovation:**  
Merges diverse digital cognitive assessments in a single, extensible platform with deterministic scoring algorithms. Continuous integration of additional validated tests, advanced environmental/context capture, and AI-powered eye and speech feature extraction represent next-gen innovation for real-world diagnosis and research.

**Project Status:**  
Currently developed a working prototype that contains the full interactive MoCA test. Expanding to more assessment modules, environment metrics (e.g., attention/eye-tracking, precise test time tracking), and longitudinal data capture in future MVP. Solution demonstrates robust tech stack and accurate scoring pipeline.

**Future Potential:**  
- Full library of digital cognitive tests, plus a “super-assessment” synthesizing best-in-class metrics
- Advanced features: Real AI vision, speech assessment (detecting subtle voice/speech issues), deep learning for behavioral/interaction analytics, digital phenotype mapping
- EHR/FHIR integration for clinical adoption
- Multilingual support, tablet/native app
- Scalable for population screening, clinical trials, and tele-neurology

#### **IV. Implementing Technology and Methodology Used**

**Core Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript, Tailwind, Konva.js/React Canvas Draw  
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI, Motor (MongoDB)  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (AES-256 at rest)  
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (OAuth/email)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render(Backend)  
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, JWT, HTTPS

**Architecture:**  
RESTful APIs handle each test and scoring module; session-based data and results.

**Methodology:**  
- Deterministic and heuristic ML-scoring (vision, language/speech) with fuzzy matching for text and audio
- Automated/manual-review triggers for results below confidence thresholds
- Upcoming voice models to analyze speech features and identify speech impairment patterns, as several tests incorporate spoken responses and recordings
- Time/behavior tracking, eye-tracking slated for next releases

***

#### **V. Datasets Used**

**Primary Data:**  
Platform collects structured digital test interactions (drawing, MCQ, speech/audio, geolocation, etc) per user session.

**Preprocessing:**  
Captures raw user signals—draws converted to vectors, speech transcribed and analyzed, scoring via fuzzy-logic, heuristics, and ML wherever validated.

**Custom Data:**  
All test data generated during user interaction. Real clinical samples or standardized patient data may be incorporated for future model training (obeying data privacy laws).
