# ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## 🎉 Backend Deployed Successfully!

**Backend URL**: https://dpcs.onrender.com ✅  
**Status**: Running and waiting for Firestore

---

## 🔥 Step 1: Enable Firestore (2 MINUTES - DO NOW!)

**WHY**: Your backend is running but database won't work without this

**HOW**:
1. Click: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dpcs-67de3/firestore
2. Click: "Create Database"
3. Select: "Production mode"
4. Choose: `us-central1`
5. Click: "Enable"
6. Wait: 2 minutes

**Test**: https://dpcs.onrender.com/health  
Should show: `"database": "connected"`

## 🌐 Step 2: Update Vercel Environment (3 MINUTES)

**WHY**: Frontend needs to know where the backend is

**HOW**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `dpcs-722m`
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Add/Update** these:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://dpcs.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://dpcs-722m.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-a-secure-random-32-char-string
```

5. Go to: **Deployments**
6. Click: "Redeploy" on latest deployment
7. Wait: 2 minutes for rebuild

---

## 🔒 Step 3: Update Backend CORS (2 MINUTES)

**WHY**: Backend needs to allow requests from Vercel

**HOW**:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select: Your service (dpcs)
3. Go to: **Environment** tab
4. **Find**: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
5. **Update to**:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://dpcs-722m.vercel.app,https://dpcs.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
```
6. Click: **Save Changes**
7. Wait: Service will auto-redeploy (1-2 minutes)

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Everything

### Test Backend:
```bash
curl https://dpcs.onrender.com/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}`

### Test Frontend:
1. Visit: https://dpcs-722m.vercel.app
2. Click: "Start Assessment"
3. Fill out consent form
4. Should create user successfully

### Check Firestore:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/dpcs-67de3/firestore
